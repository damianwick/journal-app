# Journal App
This project is a prototype of a journaling app. Users can style text in the entries using the formatting tools positioned at the bottom of the text area. Each entry can be edited or deleted. The list of created entries is displayed under the text area. Each element of that list consists of a small preview of an entry, the date when it was created and three icons: delete, edit and expand. The project is fully responsive. 

Technologies used:
* HTML
* Sass
* JavaScript
